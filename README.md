# Horiseon Website Accessibility Update

## Description

This project involved updating an existing website to improve its accessibility and semantic structure. We've made numerous updates to the HTML and CSS codebase for the Horiseon website to ensure it meets accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

## Updates Made

### HTML:

1. Replaced non-semantic div elements with semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer) for clarity of structure, improved readability, and better accessibility.

2. Added meaningful alt attributes to images to improve accessibility for visually impaired users or in cases where the image fails to load.

3. Updated the title of the webpage to make it more descriptive and relevant to the site's content.

### CSS:

No changes were made to the CSS. However, depending on your individual styles and browser defaults, some minor adjustments might be necessary to maintain the visual integrity of the site due to the added semantic tags.

## Accessibility Standards

The updates made to this website are in accordance with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) as set out by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

## Future Enhancements

Further enhancements may include adding ARIA labels and roles where necessary, ensuring the site is fully responsive and mobile-friendly, and performing ongoing checks and updates to maintain compliance with accessibility standards as they evolve.
